#QuestionableRandomThings-QRT-
Just a collection of random weapons and stuff I made for fun a while back

Thoughts on next stuff (basically WIP):
starsector DEM-like missiles
maybe actually add stats for the hauler x2, hauler x4, hauler x8, and hauler x16 ships
potentially add the archetto as an player ship, as it uses existing vanilla outfits
add ambriel and archetto (older ships that i made) into the shipyard to purchase
